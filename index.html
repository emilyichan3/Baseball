                <h2>Historical Influence</h2>
                <div> &nbsp;</div>
                <p>Baseball was introduced to Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period (1895-1945)(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule" target="_blank">Japanese rule</a>) and quickly became popular among the locals. The sport was promoted in schools and became deeply ingrained in Taiwanese society.</p>
                <p>In 1931, The <strong>Kano baseball team</strong> won second place in the 17th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_High_School_Baseball_Championship" target="_blank">Japanese High School Baseball Championship</a>, which shocked the whole of Japan.</p>

                <table>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><img src="images/kanobaseballteam1931.jpg" alt="kanobaseballteam" title="Kano Baseball Team"></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="td_img_desc">Kano Baseball Team</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>The amazing success of a team from a colonized land making to the finals was totally unexpected, and it ultimately earned the Taiwanese baseball players greater respect from their Japanese counterparts. The Kano experience also encouraged more people in Taiwan to play baseball, eventually making it the <span class="kword">"national sport"</span> in Taiwan.</p>
                <div> &nbsp;</div>
                <p>Ater World War II in 1945, baseball remained popular in Taiwan. </p>
                <div> &nbsp;</div>
                <p>In 1968, Red Leaves from the remote mountainous area in Taitung County defeated the visiting all-star little-league team from Japan, touching off a "little-league baseball craze" in Taiwan. The following year, Golden Dragon little-league baseball team, an all-star team, participated in Little League World Series for the first time and won the championship, which launched the "golden age" of Taiwan's "three youth level baseball" program comprising the little league, senior league, and big league.</p>

                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p class="small-desc">In 1971, after Taiwan's withdrawal from the United Nations, the “Tri-Champions” became an object of national pursuit; this reflected the patriotism of the age. People would crawl from their beds in the wee hours of the day to watch the young players fight for glory with their bats and gloves. When teams from Taiwan won, the streets of Taiwan would be filled with a frenzy of celebrations, and the young athletes would be treated as national heroes on their return.</p>
