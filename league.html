            <h1>Baseball League</h1>
            <p>In Taiwan, there is one primary professional baseball league, which is the <a href="https://en.cpbl.com.tw/" target="_blank">Professional Baseball League (CPBL)</a>. The CPBL is the highest level of professional baseball in Taiwan and consists of several teams competing in a league format.</p>
            <p>Additionally, there are amateur and youth baseball leagues in Taiwan, organized at various levels, including schools, universities, and community clubs. These leagues serve as important avenues for developing young talent and promoting the sport at the grassroots level. While they may not receive as much attention as the CPBL, they play a vital role in nurturing the next generation of Taiwanese baseball players.</p>
